An estimated one in three people who undergo DL do not get well and often undergo repeated surgery.1,3-6 Some studies indicate that conditions outside of the spine (e.g., depression, hip arthritis) cause people who undergo DL to do poorly,27,30-36 but no one has comprehensively examined these conditions or the impact of treating them on DL outcomes. Thus LSS treatment continues to focus on the spine alone.61 The aim of this study is to identify conditions other than LSS that place veterans at risk of poor DL outcomes so that future comparative effectiveness studies can be designed that examine the impact of a more comprehensive approach to treatment.

The evaluation study will be a collaboration led by NCDC which includes Georgetown University and AFENET to be implemented by an assembled multi-disciplinary team with proven records of research success and experience with disease surveillance program implementation; community-based participatory research, sustainability evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis. It is anticipated that the utility of data from this evaluation would inform decisions to strengthen the (IDSR) framework nationally. This is critical in promoting the best use of data collection resources to support the achievement of VHF surveillance targets and address the root cause of performance gaps in the VHF surveillance system.

The vast majority of those individuals will be prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs that provide some pain relief but do not slow the progression of the disease. Often people with knee arthritis are told they must live with the pain until they become appropriate candidates for knee replacement surgery, but that can require tolerating the pain and limiting function for many years. Because of other health issues, some individuals are never acceptable surgery candidates. What is desperately needed are better conservative approaches for treating these patients.

Often patients with CLBP do not experience relief from the many treatments they receive when these treatments are spine-centered rather than patient-centered. There are many conditions outside of the spine that can cause CLBP and disability such as hip arthritis, fibromyalgia, and depression, but healthcare providers often do not recognize and treat these conditions as part of treating CLBP. We have developed protocols tailored to the needs of older adults for treating important CLBP and disability-causing conditions.

Case-control studies have implicated eating at restaurants as a source of non-outbreak-associated infections with several disease agents (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli O157:H7). These studies, along with the substantial burden of foodborne illness outbreaks associated with commercial food establishments, were primary reasons for the formation of the Environmental Health Specialist Network (EHS-Net). Foodborne outbreaks associated with commercial food establishments still occur commonly. In the last 15 years, EHS-Net has made great strides in characterizing and publishing contributing factors and antecedents to foodborne illness in these establishments.

Uganda is located in a hot spot for these infections, many of which may be zoonotic. We propose to leverage the research and capacity building experience of the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) and its collaborative and productive relationship with the government of Uganda to study the infectious causes of acute febrile illness in both adults and children. We will use existing tools to increase the proportion of acute febrile hospitalized patients for whom we have a specific diagnosis, to implement sero-surveillance to understand exposure to various infectious diseases including vaccine preventable illness, priority pathogens, and vector-borne infections, and to study inflammatory biomarkers in children and their association with neurodevelopmental outcomes. The IDI is a research, clinical and training center of excellence. Established in 2002, the IDI has established a strong track record in performing locally relevant research that leads to improved models of care and changes in policy and practice in the area of HIV and related infections. In addition, the outreach programs largely funded by the CDC and PEPFAR as the key implementing partner took a strong health systems institutional strengthening approach to provide prevention care and treatment to more than 100,000 patients. The proposal addresses the critical barriers to achieving global health security in Uganda by collating and analyzing existing data from cohorts and diagnostic testing, and enhancing surveillance through lab capacity strengthening and technical transfer of innovative new laboratory techniques to maximize our ability to make a diagnosis. It is innovative because it leverages previous US government/PEPFAR investments in the IDI from HIV programs and uses the IDI?s expertise in research, training, clinical care, implementation, and scale-up for global health security. In addition, it leverages the close working relationship between the current and former Senior Management Team members at the IDI to recruit acutely febrile cohorts to test and implement rapid diagnostic innovation. Establishing diagnostic certainty in a larger proportion of febrile patients will allow for targeted antimicrobial treatment (reducing risk for antimicrobial resistance). It will also increase the signal sensitivity to detect new pathogens with epidemic potential. The research productivity, programmatic track record, and existing collaborative partnerships of the IDI increase the likelihood of success.

The proposed research seeks to ?close the loop? on this public health problem by employing system engineering methods in three diverse healthcare practices to create a system that provides highly reliable follow-up of diagnostic tests, referrals, and symptom evolution.

Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the mission from the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control in regard to evaluation of strategies that will directly improve the ability of state and local health departments to implement and improve interventions that can be immediately translated into action to prevent fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose from prescription and/or illicit opioids.",7805826; ,"PICKARD, ALAN SIMON;",,9/30/2019,9/29/2022,,Impacting the Prescribing of Opioids through Academic Detailing,3156,ZCE1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,1,,,761202,
